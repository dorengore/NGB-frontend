          2. Disclosure and transfer of personal data?
        </h2>
        <p className="text-base leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Your personal data may be disclosed to Organizers, sponsors or
          partners when You participate in activities or competitions hosted by
          them. We may also disclose Your personal data to service providers
          that we use to provide the Platform. The service providers consist of
          the following categories: (i) payment solutions, such as PayPal and
          (ii) IT services providers. Natural Born Gamers will not intentionally
          disclose or share any personal data about You to third parties without
          Your consent, except where Natural Born Gamers, in good faith,
          believes such disclosure is necessary to comply with applicable law or
          contractual provisions in our Terms of Use. Natural Born Gamers always
          tries to process Your personal data within the EU/EEA. However, in
          some situations, as described in the table below, Your personal data
          may be transferred to and processed in a country outside the EU/EEA.
          We are therefore applying appropriate safeguards for the transfers to
          these recipients through one of the following measures: The country of
          destination is on the European Commission&apos;s list of countries
          with an adequate level of protection; or By implementing the relevant
          module (as applicable) of the European Commission&apos;s standard
          contractual clauses. When transferring personal data based on the
          European Commission&apos;s standard contractual clauses, we will
          assess the level of protection provided by the third country and take
          additional technical or organizational measures to ensure a sufficient
          level of protection for the transferred personal data if necessary.

        <p className="text-base leading-relaxed mb-6">
          A &quot;cookie&quot; is a small text file sent from Natural Born
          Gamers&apos;s server to Your browser. The cookie cannot identify You
          personally and can only recognize the browser that is installed on
          Your computer which is used to access the Platform. Different cookies
          are sent to different computers if You access the Platform from
          different computers. Cookies are required for the Platform to function
          correctly and safely, for example when You login to Your User Account.
          Cookies are also used to measure the data traffic to the Platform and
          for statistical reasons. There are two types of cookies: one type is
          called &quot;session cookies&quot;, and the other is called
          &quot;permanent cookies&quot;. The Platform uses both session cookies
          and permanent cookies. A session cookie is sent between Your computer
          and Natural Born Gamers&apos;s server in order for the Platform to
          work properly during Your visit. A session cookie disappears when the
          browser is closed and is thus not stored on the computer. A permanent
          cookie is stored in Your computer and allows the Platform to recognize
          Your computer&apos;s IP address and web browser the next time You
          login. You can opt-out from our use of cookies on Your computer by
          editing a setting in Your browser. Such settings may imply that
          certain functions on the Platform will not function properly or be
          available.
